# VulnerabilityPolicy
Vulnerability Management Policy Sample

Purpose:
This policy aims to identify and resolve potential security vulnerabilities that may arise during the creation, deployment, or setup of technological resources such as hardware, software, data, and authentication details. Upholding principles of fairness and social responsibility, the policy aligns with the organization's dedication to maintaining equitable practices and promoting social justice.


Applicability and Audience
Users
This policy is relevant to all staff members who hold responsibilities related to the ownership and maintenance of technological resources.


Technology Assets
This policy applies to all organization-owned and operated technology assets.
This policy is also relevant for all externally owned and managed technological assets that are utilized to facilitate the organization's service delivery or are situated within the organization's infrastructures. The processes for vulnerability identification and rectification may vary based on the nature of ownership and operation of the asset.
Personal technological resources are generally outside the purview of this policy, with the exception of instances where security mechanisms identify a system as vulnerable, such as when a personal device attempts to establish a connection, or when a mobile device seeks to access the organization's email service.

Exceptions
Requests for exceptions to this policy must follow the organization's information security policy exceptions handling process.


Policy
All technology assets must be protected through the deployment and installation of security patches and updates provided by the manufacturer for the purpose of remediating a security risk. If security patches or updates cannot be installed, then alternative solutions to mitigate the security risk must be identified and implemented.


Vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and other monitoring and auditing will be periodically performed by the Chief Information Security and Privacy Officer to verify that vulnerabilities are mitigated in a timely manner.


There are five (5) primary processes that must be followed to appropriately manage vulnerabilities:


Identification
Vulnerabilities are identified through various methods including publication sources, scans, assessments, and tests, with the Chief Information Security and Privacy Officer responsible for monitoring these sources and providing information about new vulnerabilities to the relevant personnel, who then assess and respond to high-criticality vulnerabilities as per established procedures.


Risk Assessment
While a risk assessment isn't mandatory for each vulnerability, it can be used to decrease its priority if mitigating factors exist, but in its absence, the vulnerability should be handled based on the highest known risk rating, and any such mitigating factors must receive approval from the Chief Information Security and Privacy Officer.


Prioritization and Mitigation plan
Discovered vulnerabilities are prioritized and mitigated based on severity and industry standards, utilizing a variety of methods like installing patches, disabling unnecessary services, and modifying security controls, with resolutions to be made within designated time windows depending on the severity, and the process is overseen by the Chief Information Security, Privacy Officer, and delegates.





Patch Management and Deployment
The IT team will obtain and oversee unified systems that enable the efficient handling of system updates and configuration control for all tech resources. Updates will be rolled out according to a predetermined process for managing changes. Regular examinations should be carried out on all tech resources to identify any missing updates or fixes. Installation of these updates or patches is mandatory unless they result in negative consequences. Any postponement in rolling out these updates due to the said consequences should be noted down and communicated to the head of information security.


Validation
Confirmation is crucial in the process of updating systems and rectifying vulnerabilities, to ensure that patches are applied correctly and vulnerabilities are successfully resolved. The main security official regularly carries out in-depth security checks and vulnerability evaluations, which includes automated scanning. This is done to detect and alleviate possible security threats.


Implementation Plan
This policy will be applicable throughout the organization from the day it is endorsed by the Chief Information Officer. Any introduction of new technology or significant updates to current technology need to be in line with this policy starting from the date it comes into effect.

Maintenance
The organization's IT team will manage this policy, which encompasses interpretation, ensuring its relevance, suggesting modifications, establishing a procedure for dealing with and mitigating non-compliance issues, aiding groups in understanding compliance requirements, and conducting yearly compliance checks.

This policy will naturally cease to be in effect five years from the date it becomes effective. Before its expiration, the organization's IT department will commence the creation of a new, updated, or renewed policy.

Consequences for Noncompliance
Non-adherence to this policy could result in disciplinary steps, including possible termination. Legal action, civil or criminal, may also ensue depending on realized damages as a result of non-adherence.
